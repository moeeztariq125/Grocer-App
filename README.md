Hi,
This Grocer App was made thinking about UI perspectives. You can integrate multiple sub features and API calls into the skeleton. 

There is a folder for providers where you can introduce provider for minor state management. For a full fledged solution, it would be your preference to use ContextAPI or other state management tools.

How to run:
Clone the repo into your system.
run: npm i
run: npm run dev

The app will start on you local host

Thank!
